# Home Assistant configuration!
#
# This system is modular and differently structured compared to other
# configurations found online.
#
# Each file does 1 thing only, for the most part. Simple one-line integration
# files will go here whereas larger integration files will go into packages.
#
# The configuration.yaml is only used to bootstrap the system.
