# Home Assistant configuration!
#
# My system is very modular and very differently structured
# compared to other configurations you'll find online.
#
# Basically, each file does 1 thing only.
#
# The configuration.yaml is only used to bootstrap the system
# and contains some minimal, but vital, settings.
