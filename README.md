Home Assistant runs on a [Raspberry Pi 3](http://amzn.to/2e3DOBY). The main SD Card is 32GB.

If you want to back up your own Home Assistant configuration to GitHub, follow [this guide](https://home-assistant.io/docs/ecosystem/backup/backup_github/).

It's super buggy for short fades (< 60 seconds), more stable for longer fades.
