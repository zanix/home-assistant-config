## Disabled Integrations

This is a list of integrations that are currently disabled, but have not been removed because I think I still might use them someday.

- [Attributes](https://github.com/pilotak/homeassistant-attributes) - Allows the creation of a sensor that breaks out attribute of defined entities. Was used this to separate `battery_level` attributes into their own sensors, but now is inactive since Home Assistant does this natively.
- Python Zwave Fade : [Forum Post](https://community.home-assistant.io/t/light-fade-in/35509/19) : [My Current Code](https://github.com/zanix/home-assistant-config/blob/master/python_scripts/zwave_fade.py) - Fade Zwave lights over time. It's super buggy for short fades (< 60 seconds), more stable for longer fades.
