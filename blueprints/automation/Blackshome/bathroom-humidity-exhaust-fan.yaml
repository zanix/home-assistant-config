    <summary><b>The Automation Process:</b> 👈</summary>

      - **Auto Trigger:**
          - When the derivative percentage rises above a set value, the fan turns ON
          - When the derivative percentage falls below a set value, the automation waits for a time delay and then turns the fan OFF.
          - Optional - Set a maximum humidity percentage to trigger the fan ON. This is useful when having back-to-back showers.

          **Note:** You must have a humidity sensor in the bathroom and set up a 'Derivative Helper' for this automation to work.

      - **Manual Trigger Option:**
          - This feature allows you to manually trigger the automation.

      - **Multi-Speed Fan Control Option:**
          - You have the option to use fan speeds to control the staging of your fan.
          - You can choose to stage your fan in your preferred configuration, such as High/Off, High/Low, High/Low/Off, High/Med/Low, etc.

      - **Winter Mode Option:**
          - You have the option to use 'Winter Mode.' This mode allows for different settings to be applied, accommodating the typically higher humidity levels experienced in winter compared to summer.

      - **Light Control Option:**
          - Use the "Light Control" option to turn ON lights, adjusting brightness levels, colour temperatures, and transition times.
          - This feature is commonly utilized with LED lights in a shower niche.
          - For expanded lighting options, consider integrating my 💡[Sensor Light](https://community.home-assistant.io/t/481048) blueprint, which utilizes the automation link feature.

      - **Manual Control Option:**
          - Use a manual fan switch to toggle the fan ON/OFF.
          - Opt to use the auto-OFF option for timer-like functionality.
          - This is particularly useful for removing unwanted fumes from deodorant, hairspray, or the toilet.

      - **Automation Link Option:**
          - This feature simplifies the process of automatically disabling your other automations by providing an automation linking mechanism.

      - **Bypass Functionality Option:**
          - This allows you to bypass the automation, offering manual control and additional customization capabilities.

      - **Safety Measures:**
          - Set a maximum runtime safeguard for the fan to prevent continuous operation.
          - Benefit from built-in safeguards to ensure smooth operation and reliability, even if Home Assistant restarts.

          description: This feature allows you to manually trigger the automation.
            It replaces the humidity derivative settings in either 'Default - Summer Mode' or 'Winter Mode,' configurations.
            Turning it ON initiates the automation process, and turning it OFF starts the time delay.
            Note that auto triggers can and will override the manual trigger option if triggered.


            If you choose option 1, the 'Safeguard - Maximum Run Time' will be active in 'Default - Summer Mode' or 'Winter Mode' and will turn OFF the manual trigger if you forget to do so.
            Alternatively, option 2 allows you to customize different auto OFF time delays for both 'Default - Summer Mode' and 'Winter Mode' settings.
            If using the winter mode, ensure it is enabled below in the 'Winter Mode' section.


            This feature can operate with or without a humidity sensor, which is particularly useful if the humidity sensor malfunctions, allowing time for repairs and reducing stress levels.
            Additionally, it can initiate the fan to turn ON before a shower, aiding in humidity removal before the auto triggers take over.
            It is designed with good spouse approval in mind.
