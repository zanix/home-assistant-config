# Changes the activity on a Harmony remote.
#
# Remote devices and input select entities should be named as follows:
#   - input_select.remote_living_room
#   - remote.living_room
# The automation replaces "input_select.remote_" with "remote.living_room" and
# passes it to the script which sets the action and resets the input select.
